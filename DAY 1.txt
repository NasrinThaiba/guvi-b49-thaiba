Day-1 tasks

1. write a blog on difference between HTTP 1.1 Vs HTTP 2?

HTTP 1.1:
- Version 1.1 was released in 1997 and became the internet standard
- It loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it
- Some methods and response codes are added

HTTP 2:
- Version 2 was released in February 2015 by the internet engineering task force (IETF) focussed on improving HTTP performance
- It is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other
resource
- support of parallel request transmission by 'stream' (elimination of HTTP HoL Blocking)


2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

- Objects in javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data of primitive or reference types in the form of 
key:value pairs.
- These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods respectively in the context of an object.
- The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object and access the properties of an object with a simple
dot-notation.
